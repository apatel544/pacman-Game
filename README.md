# PacMen Factory

Factory for making pacmen. This app producs a PacMan on the click of a button by using array methods and DOM manipulation to animate them across the screen at random speeds. 

Some ideas I have for this would be to add the four different ghosts Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Clyde from the Pac-Man franchise to also be added to the mix.
